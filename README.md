# Advance JavaScript

## What is Programming Language ?
A programming language is a means of communicating with a computer. It is a language that developers use to create specific instructions for computers.These languages ‚Äã‚Äãtell the computer how to process data, perform calculations, or how to produce output.

## what is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a high-level programming language commonly used in web browsers and web pages. It is a **scripting language** used to create dynamic content, such as interactive forms, real-time updates, and animations.It is a client-side scripting language but is now also used for server-side (Node.js) work.

## Behavior of JavaScript
JavaScript is a **single-threaded** language, meaning it can execute only one line of code at a time. But with the help of **asynchronous** Web APIs and Event loops, it can execute more than one **asynchronous** task simultaneously.

# JavaScript Execution Workflow
![JS-DOM-PROJECT Screenshot](./screenshot.png)
## 1. JavaScript Engine
- **I. Call Stack**: Here all **synchronous** tasks are executed one after the other.
- **II.Memory Heap**: Data is stored here (like variables, objects, etc.).
## 2. Web APIs
- **I. Asynchronous** tasks (such as setTimeout, fetch, DOM events) are handled by the browser or Node.js' **Web APIs**.
## 3. Task Queue (Callback Queue)
- **I.** When Web APIs complete a task, send the **callback** for that task here.
## 4. Microtask Queue
- **I.** This **Queue** is used for **.then()** or **.catch()** of Promise or Fetch API.
- **II. Microtask Queue** always has higher priority than **Task Queue.**
## 5. Event Loop
- **I.** The **Event Loop** constantly checks, if the **Call Stack** is empty, moves the task from the **Task Queue** or **Microtask Queue** to the Call Stack and executes it.
